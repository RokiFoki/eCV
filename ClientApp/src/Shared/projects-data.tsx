Alternatively, players can join factions. There are Police Departments in big cities and Sheriffs' Departments in villages that are supposed to fight crime. Other factions such as ambulance, firefighters, FBI, government, hitman agency, and others make the roleplay very exciting. Custom casinos have been designed and implemented, allowing users to play Holdem Texas Poker. Players distribute given skill points to their character skills. That makes them unique to other players. Available skills were: strength, health, speed, agility, shooting, reflexes, intelligence, poker, detective, and others. There are other features that the roleplay server offers.
